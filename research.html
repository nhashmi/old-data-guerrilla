		<h4>with Amanda Glassman, Charles Kenny, and Justin Sandefur</h4>
		<h5>CGD Working Paper | February 2015</h5>
			<p>Since 2001, an aid consortium known as Gavi has accounted for over half of vaccination expenditure in the 75 eligible countries with an initial per capita GNI below $1,000. Regression discontinuity (RD) estimates show aid significantly displaced other immunization efforts and failed to increase vaccination rates for diseases covered by cheap, existing vaccines. For some newer and more expensive vaccines, i.e., Hib and rotavirus, we found large effects on vaccination and limited fungibility, though statistical significance is not robust. These RD estimates apply to middle-income countries near Gavi's eligibility threshold, and cannot rule out differential effects for the poorest countries.</p>

		<h4>with Benjamin Dykstra and Justin Sandefur</h4>
		<h5>CGD Working Paper | April 2014</h5>
			<p>Much of the data underlying global poverty and inequality estimates is not in the public domain, but can be accessed in small pieces using the World Bank’s PovcalNet online tool. To overcome these limitations and reproduce this database in a format more useful to researchers, we ran approximately 23 million queries of the World Bank’s web site, accessing only information that was already in the public domain. This web scraping exercise produced 10,000 points on the cumulative distribution of income or consumption from each of 942 surveys spanning 127 countries over the period 1977 to 2012. This short note describes our methodology, briefly discusses some of the relevant intellectual property issues, and illustrates the kind of calculations that are facilitated by this data set, including growth incidence curves and poverty rates using alternative PPP indices.

		<h4>with Charles Kenny</h4>
		<h5>CGD Policy Paper | July 2013</h5>
			<p>The eighth Millennium Development Goal (MDG 8) covered a &lsquo;global partnership for development&rsquo; in areas including aid, trade, debt relief, drugs, and information and communications technology (ICT). Since the goal was formulated, there has been progress as well as gaps in the areas which were covered.<br><br>In this paper, Charles Kenny reviews what worked and what didn’t with MDG 8 and proposes alternatives for a post-2015 development agenda. The world has changed since the original MDGs were created. By 2030, a global compact on development progress linking OECD-DAC aid and policy reform to low-income countries as target beneficiaries (the implicit model of MDG 8) would be irrelevant to three-quarters of the world. Half of the rich world will be in non-DAC countries, and the share of aid in global transfers will continue to shrink. Global public goods provision will increasingly require the active participation of (at least) the G-20 nations.<br><br>A post-2015 global partnership agenda should involve a mixed approach to compact and partnership issues: binding “global compact” targets under specific post-2015 sectoral goals focused on the role for aid alongside a stand-alone global public goods goal with time-bound, numerical targets covering trade, investment, migration, technology, the environment and global institutions.</p>
