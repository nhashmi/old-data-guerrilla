			<blockquote><p>There are still 27 countries that discriminate against women in their nationality laws and prevent them from passing their nationality onto their children. In over 60 countries, women are prevented from acquiring, changing, or retaining their nationality in the same way as men. This gender discrimination violates international law and has severe consequences for families around the world.</p></blockquote>

			<blockquote><p>Around one-quarter of women worldwide suggest that wife beating can be justified if she does something like arguing with her husband or burning dinner according to the World Bank report. Women who agree with any justification for wife beating are at a considerably higher risk of violence than those who do not. And in many countries, the police are loath to intervene in domestic violence cases. In India, 94 percent of police agree that a husband may rape his wife.</p></blockquote>
